This tool require some setup : 

- For .uassets:
Get this .exe :      https://github.com/atenfyr/UAssetGUI/releases 

- For .locres:
Get this .exe :      https://github.com/amrshaheen61/UE4LocalizationsTool/releases/tag/v2.7

- The "template" folder for .pak that we use for modding. (Included in the repo but just in case)

- Head to Database and edit resources.py in function, to point the patht to those tools, as well as other things.
I gave guidelines on what's expected at the end of the path.

There is no package requirements, the tool creates and manage his own venv.
However Python 3.12 is required at least.
